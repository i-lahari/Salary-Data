# Salary-Data
Fitting Simple Linear Regression Model on Salary Data

**Overview**
This project implements Simple Linear Regression from scratch to predict salaries based on years of experience. The implementation demonstrates the fundamental concepts of linear regression without using built-in machine learning libraries.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains two columns:

Years of Experience

Salary

**Insight**
1. No outliers in both the columns
2. Majority of them are paid around 60,000
3. Most of them have 3-5 years of experience
4. The frequencies are not uniform, with some bins (e.g., around 8 years) having fewer counts compared to others
5. Positive Corelation - Salary is increasing as the number of years in experience increases.
6. **Holds Linear Relationship** between dependent and independent variables - Satisfied the assumption of linear regression
